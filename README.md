# Forecasting/Predicting Gentrification in NYC Area with Yelp Data 
## Project Scope

Yelp is a great platform to obtain real-time data which could help us understand the socio-economic changes in neighborhoods. In the first part of the study, I am going to use housing price as the measure of neighborhood change and see if the change in businesses correlates to the increase/decrease in housing prices in the metropolitan area in NY. In the second part, I am going to try predicting gentrification in NYC using Yelp data, combined with other demographic measures from 2016 Census.

## Procedure
1) Collecting the data
- data 

## Results
